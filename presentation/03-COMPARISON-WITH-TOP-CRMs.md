## 1. How Cadence Fits

> **In short:** Cadence is a **cloud CRM** that focuses on **writing sales copy** and **managing core sales data** (leads, deals, contacts, companies, tasks, activities). It runs in the cloud — access from any browser; no installs. No external CRM required.

**What Cadence does:**

- **Writes sales copy** — Emails, follow-ups, CRM notes, deal messages. You pick type and goal; the system drafts text in your company name and brand tone (Professional / Friendly / Persuasive).
- **Holds sales data** — Leads, deals (pipeline with stages), contacts, companies, tasks, activities. You can **convert a lead** to a contact and/or deal in one step.
- **Sends copy to a contact or deal** — You pick who it’s for; it’s saved in History in the cloud so you can reuse, regenerate, or send again.
- **Runs in the cloud** — Cloud CRM; access from anywhere. No installs; your data is stored securely in the cloud.

**Top CRMs** are full platforms: sales + marketing + service, teams and roles, integrations (email, calendar, telephony), forecasting, custom reports, and enterprise security (SSO, audit, compliance). This comparison is **feature-level** — it shows where Cadence matches them and where it doesn’t, and **when to choose Cadence** vs when to choose an enterprise CRM.

## 5. Summary — What We Have vs What Others Have

**We have (and top CRMs typically have too):**

- Leads (list, search, add, edit, delete, company, source, status); **convert lead to contact and/or deal**.
- Contacts and companies (list, search, add, edit); link contact to company.
- Pipeline (stages, value, close date, won/lost); Kanban; add, edit, delete, move stage.
- Tasks (due date, link to lead/deal, complete); Activities (log call/meeting/email/note; filter by contact/deal).
- Dashboard (active leads, deals, pipeline value, won/lost; copy stats; recent activity).
- Login, 2FA, per-user data.

**We have and many top CRMs only partly have:**

- **Sales copy generation** (5 types, 6 goals, brand tone) and send to contact/deal with History (regenerate, send again).
- **Cloud CRM** — access from any browser; optional self-host at no per-seat cost (demo or full stack).

**We don’t have (vs top CRMs):**

- Roles (admin/manager/rep), teams, shared records, manager/team dashboards.
- Lead assignment UI, lead scoring (we do have convert).
- Contact–deal link in UI, “last activity” on contact/deal.
- Products/line items on deals, revenue forecasting.
- Email/calendar/telephony integrations, app marketplace.
- Custom reports, export.
- SSO/SAML, audit log, compliance certifications (e.g. GDPR, SOC 2).

## 6. When to Choose Cadence vs Enterprise CRM

**Choose Cadence when:**

- You want **sales copy** (emails, follow-ups, notes, deal messages) in your brand voice **and** core CRM (leads, pipeline, contacts, companies, tasks, activities) in one place.
- You prefer **running on your own machine** (demo or full stack) with no required subscription or third-party CRM.
- You’re a **single user or small team** where each person can have their own account and data doesn’t need to be shared.
- You need **convert lead to contact/deal**, pipeline by stage, dashboard stats, and copy history — and you **don’t** need lead scoring, team/manager views, or heavy integrations.

**Choose an enterprise CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, Monday) when:**

- You need **roles** (admin, manager, rep), **teams**, **shared records**, and **manager/team dashboards**.
- You need **integrations** (email, calendar, telephony, marketing automation, ERP) or an app marketplace.
- You need **lead assignment**, **lead scoring**, **revenue forecasting**, **products/line items** on deals, or **custom reports** and **export**.
- You need **SSO/SAML**, **audit logs**, or **compliance certifications** (e.g. GDPR, SOC 2).

**Hybrid:** You can use Cadence for **copy generation and send-to-CRM** while using another system for team/organization. “Connect your CRM” can later integrate with external CRMs when that flow is built.

## 7. Positioning Takeaways

**Cadence strengths:** **Cloud CRM** — runs in the cloud; access from any browser; no installs. **Sales copy generation** with brand tone (5 types, 6 goals, templates); full lead/deal/contact/company/task/activity core; **convert lead to contact/deal**; simple pipeline and dashboard; copy history (regenerate, send again). Optional self-host for advanced users.

**Gaps vs top CRMs:** No teams or roles in UI (target vision: organizations; backend has org APIs); no lead assignment or scoring (we have convert); no contact–deal link or last-activity field in UI; no integrations or custom reporting; no SSO/audit/compliance. Use these when comparing or planning the roadmap.
